## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate all reports for the last 30 days
poetry run fs-report --period 30d

# Generate a specific report
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Executive Summary" --period 30d

# List available reports

## Available Reports

### Executive Summary

**Purpose:** High-level security dashboard for leadership and stakeholders.

**Who should use it:** Executives, security leadership, program managers

**What it shows:**
- Overall security posture across all projects
- Distribution of findings by severity
- Security trends over time
- Project-level risk breakdown

**Key visualizations:**
- **Project Breakdown Chart** — How findings are distributed across projects
- **Open Issues Distribution** — Unresolved findings by severity level
- **Security Findings Over Time** — Monthly discovery trends

**What to look for:**
| Healthy | Needs Attention |
|---------|-----------------|
| Majority low/medium severity | High concentration of critical findings |
| Open issues decreasing | Growing backlog of unresolved issues |
| Consistent discovery trends | Sudden spikes in findings |
| Risk spread across projects | One project dominates risk |

**Example command:**
```bash
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Executive Summary" --period 90d
```

### Component Vulnerability Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify which software components create the most risk across your portfolio.

**Who should use it:** Security teams, architects, remediation planners

**What it shows:**
- Highest-risk components across all projects
- Which components affect the most projects
- Composite risk scores combining severity and impact
- Strategic remediation priorities

**Key visualizations:**
- **Pareto Chart** — Component risk ranking with cumulative percentage (focus on the left side)
- **Bubble Chart** — Risk score vs project impact (look for items in upper right)

**How to prioritize:**

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Immediate** | High risk + many projects | Fix first for maximum impact |
| **Quick wins** | Very high risk + few projects | Easy to remediate |
| **Strategic** | Medium risk + many projects | Plan coordinated updates |
| **Monitor** | Low risk + few projects | Track but don't prioritize |

**Example command:**
```bash
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Component Vulnerability Analysis" --period 30d
```

### Findings by Project

**Purpose:** Detailed security findings inventory organized by project.

**Who should use it:** Development teams, project managers, security analysts

**What it shows:**
- Complete list of security findings per project
- CVSS scores and severity levels
- Affected components and versions
- CVE identifiers and exploit information

**Key data columns:**
- **CVSS Score** — Vulnerability severity (0-10 scale)
- **Component & Version** — Specific vulnerable software
- **Project Name** — Which project contains the finding
- **Exploit/Weaponization Count** — Known active threats

**Project health indicators:**
| Status | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| **Healthy** | Low CVSS scores (<7.0), minimal exploits, manageable count |
| **Needs Attention** | Multiple high CVSS findings, some exploit activity |
| **Critical** | CVSS >8.0, active exploits, large volumes |

**Example commands:**
```bash
# All projects
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Findings by Project" --period 30d

# Specific project
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Findings by Project" --project "MyProject"
```

### Scan Analysis

**Purpose:** Monitor scanning infrastructure performance and understand team scanning patterns.

**Who should use it:** DevSecOps, operations teams, platform administrators

**What it shows:**
- Scan throughput and completion rates
- Success vs failure rates by day
- Average scan durations
- Queue status and backlogs
- **New:** Version tracking to identify duplicate submissions
- **New:** New vs existing project breakdown
- **New:** Failure type distribution

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Scans** | Volume of scanning activity |
| **Projects (new/existing)** | Are teams creating new projects or reusing existing ones? |
| **Versions** | Unique artifacts processed |
| **Success Rate** | Reliability of scanning infrastructure |
| **Avg Duration** | Performance health |
| **Failed Scans** | Issues requiring investigation |

**Key visualizations:**
- **Throughput Chart** — Daily scans started vs completed with trend lines
- **Success Rate** — Daily reliability percentages
- **Scan Type Distribution** — Workload balance across SCA, SAST, CONFIG, etc.
- **Failure Type Distribution** — Which scan types fail most often

**Understanding new vs existing projects:**
- **High "new" ratio** — Rapid onboarding of new products
- **High "existing" ratio** — Mature, ongoing security processes
- **All new projects** — May indicate workflow issues (teams not reusing projects)

**Operational health:**
| Status | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| **Healthy** | >95% success rate, stable durations, minimal queue |
| **Needs Attention** | Declining success, growing durations, queue building |
| **Critical** | <90% success, high variability, large backlogs |

**Example command:**
```bash
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Scan Analysis" --period 14d
```

---

### Component List

**Purpose:** Complete software inventory (SBOM) across your portfolio.

**Who should use it:** Compliance teams, legal, engineering leadership

**What it shows:**
- All software components in use
- Component versions, types, and suppliers
- License information
- Associated projects, versions, and branches
- Risk metrics per component (findings, warnings, violations)

**Key data columns:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Component** | Software component name |
| **Version** | Specific version in use |
| **Type** | Library, framework, etc. |
| **Supplier** | Vendor or maintainer |
| **Licenses** | License information for compliance |
| **Project/Version/Branch** | Where the component is used |
| **Findings/Warnings/Violations** | Risk indicators |

**Use cases:**
- **SBOM Compliance** — Export for regulatory requirements
- **License Reviews** — Filter by license type for legal review
- **Standardization** — Identify version fragmentation
- **Risk Assessment** — Focus on high-finding components

**Example commands:**
```bash
# Portfolio-wide inventory
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Component List"

# Specific project
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Component List" --project "MyProject"

# Specific version
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Component List" --version "1234567890"
```

|--------|-------------------|
| **Unique Users** | Total distinct users with activity |
| **Days with Activity** | Platform usage consistency |
| **Avg Daily Users** | Typical daily engagement level |
