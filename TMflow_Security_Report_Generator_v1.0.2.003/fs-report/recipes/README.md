## Usage

To generate a report, use the CLI and specify the recipe name. For example:

```bash
# Run a specific report
poetry run fs-report --recipe "Component Vulnerability Analysis"

# Run all available reports
poetry run fs-report

# List all available recipes
poetry run fs-report list-recipes
```

Replace the recipe name with any of the available options above. The output will be saved in the `output/` directory by default.
